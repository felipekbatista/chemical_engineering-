# Plant Design

This is the projected biodiesel plant that uses hydroesterefication as the process. 

The design contains the following processes

- hydrolysis equilibrium reactor
- liquid-liquid separation vessels
- hydroesterefication conversion reactor
- distillation columns 

The design also contains recycles that were made possible due to use of calculator blocks

The products are shown in the table bellow

| stream | product (kg/h) | purity |
| ------ | -------------- | ------ |
| 16     | 7116           | 0.993  |
| 34     | 737            | 0.975  |
