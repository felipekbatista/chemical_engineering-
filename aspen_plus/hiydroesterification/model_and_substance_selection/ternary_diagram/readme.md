# Ternary Diagrams

These files are related to the selection of substances and their qualitative behavior regarding phase split. 

The classes of substances used are showed here and also the proposed ternary diagrams for analysis.

## Substances

The biodiesel process uses the following classes of substances:

- Triacylglycerol (TAG)
- free fatty acid (FFA)
- water
- alcohol (methanol)
- ester (biodiesel)
- glycerol

# Ternary diagrams

The ternary diagrams are used for phase split analysis. The following components are tested with different methods.

- TAG + water + FFA
- TAG + FFA + glycerol
- FFA + water + glycerol
- FFA + methanol + water
- FFA + ester + water
