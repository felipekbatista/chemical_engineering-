**readme**  for the model and substance selection

These files are related to the selection of the thermodynamic model and substances.

## Substances

The biodiesel process uses the following substances:

- Triacylglycerol (TAG)
- fatty acid (FA)
- water
- alcohol 
- ester
- glycerol

---

## Thermodynamic model

Due to the fact that this process involves water and oil, a two-phase liquid-liquid thermodynamic model needs to be selected for good phase split.

**Tests**

- Terdiagram for phase split of substances[^1]
- Hydrolysis equilibrium for the hydrolysis reaction [^2] 
- Hydroesterfication equilibrium for the hydroesterefication reaction [^3]



[^1]: This diagram is to observe the behavior of phase separation of the components. Water, TAG, FA;

For selection of the model, ternary diagrams are used to evaluate the phase separation of water and other components.
