# Model and substance selection

These files are related to the selection of the thermodynamic model and substances.

## Substances

The biodiesel process uses the following classes of substances:

- Triacylglycerol (TAG)
- free fatty acid (FFA)
- water
- alcohol 
- ester
- glycerol

---

## Thermodynamic model

Due to the fact that this process involves water and oil (TAG and FFA), a two-phase liquid-liquid thermodynamic model needs to be selected for good phase split.

The base tests for choosing a thermodynamic model that best suits are three:

**Tests**

1. Terdiagram for phase split of substances
2. Gibbs free energy for binary composition
3. Hydrolysis equilibrium
4. Hydroesterification equilibrium

These tests are to validate qualitatively the phase split of components (tests 1 and 2) and if the reactions proceed to equilibrium (tests 3 and 4) for use if there is no kinetics 

 

## TAGs

These represent the main component of vegetable oil. There are several TAGs available and they may behave differently, so, there is a need to test differents TAGs and their behaviour with water (phase split).

- TAG + Water



## FFA

After hydrolysis, FFA are formed and they are the product together with glycerol.   In the environment where it's formed, there is water, glycerol and TAGs.  Because of this, phase split tests are needed to find FFAs that behave accordingly with water and glycerol

- FFA + water
- FFA + glycerol
- FFA + alcohol 

## Glycerol

Byproduct of the hydrolysis reaction, this polyalcohol is formed in an environment with FFA, TAG and water. Because it is very soluble in water, it is expected that natural phase split occurs with most of glycerol moving to water phase.

- glycerol + water
- glycerol + TAG
- glycerol + FFA

## Alcohol

Used in the hydroesterefication reaction, it is present in the reactor with FFA and forms ester (biodiesel) and water. The alcohol that is used is methanol

- methanol + water
- methanol + FFA
- methanol + ester



# Ternary diagrams

The ternary diagrams are used for phase split analysis. The following components are tested with different methods.

1) TAG + water + FFA

2. TAG + FFA + glycerol

3. FFA + water + glycerol

4. FFA + methanol + water

5. FFA + ester + water
