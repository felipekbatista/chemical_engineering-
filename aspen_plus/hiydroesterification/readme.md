**readme** for the hydrosterefication

> This process is related to my scientific initiation, where the goal is to simulate a process to produce biodiesel via the hydrosterification reactions.



The basic process contains the following reactions that must be modeled

```python
1 - Hydrolysis
	Water + TAG --> FA + Glycerol
```

```
2 - Hydroesterefication
	TAG + Alcohol --> Biodiesel + water
```



## Literature

Base literature that is the reference for general ideas of the process

## Steps

Steps that are involved in the making of the process
