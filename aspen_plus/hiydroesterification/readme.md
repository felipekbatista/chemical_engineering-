# Hydroesterfication

This process is related to my scientific initiation, where the goal is to simulate a process to produce biodiesel via the hydroesterefication reactions.



The process is made up of two base reactions, the hydrolysis and the hydroesterefication

```python
1 - Hydrolysis reaction
	Water + TAG --> FFA + Glycerol
```

```
2 - Hydroesterefication
	TAG + Alcohol --> Biodiesel + water
```



## Literature

Base literature that is the reference for general ideas of the process

- Geração de biodiesel pelos processos de transesterificação e hidroesterificação, uma avaliação econômica - Ana Paula Gama Encarnação - 2008
